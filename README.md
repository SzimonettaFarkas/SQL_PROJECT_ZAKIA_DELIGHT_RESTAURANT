# SQL_PROJECT_ZAKIA_DELIGHT_RESTAURANT

Zakia, a lovely friend of mine, has always dreamed of running an
own restaurant. At 01/01/2023 her dream came true and she could
open her small, neat and cosy diner located in the city center of
Frankfurt, Germany.
 Zakia‘s Delight offers 10 kind of dishes: Chicken Stew, Vegetable
Stew, Fruit Salad, French Fries, Hungarian Chicken Soup,
Cheeseburger with French Fries, Vegetable Soup, Greek Salad, Beef
- Vegetable Soup and Cheesecake.
 My dear friend wants to keep her restaurant as a happy, successful
place, so she requested me to help analyzing a collection of data
about her customers.

Zakia wants to create a stronger and deeper connection with her customers. She
wants to know more about their favorite dishes, visiting patterns and about how
much money they have spent. So, she prepared a list of questions and asked my
help to answer them.
The restaurant has a loyality program which is planned to be expanded, we need
insights from the data collected from customers, so we can improve their dining
experience.
Due to privacy issues we are provided with a sample of the overall customer
data.
